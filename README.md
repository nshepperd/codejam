Google Code Jam
===============

This repo is an archive of my solutions to the GCJ (http://code.google.com/codejam/) problems each year that I have competed. The build system is [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/). Since the solutions are developed under pressure, they won't be much commented, so you probably want to have the problem statements open while reading :) But I hope the code will be readable regardless.
